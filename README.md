## What is the project about
This project builds a **musical composition** through the implementation of a simple version of a music software. This music software comprises the addition of different music plugins or addons representing several instruments that the user might be able to interact with, which are connected in a design interface.

This software is made using the **Jython Music** framework which provides some libraries and examples for music programming using Python.

## Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/alexgimenez02/TTMP31
cd jythonMusic
java -jar JEM.jar
```
With the integrated IDE JEM.jar already opened, open the file named main.py and run it.
When the file is executed, an interface should be displayed.

## Requirements 
Compatible operating systems: Windows, Linux, Mac

Python 3.8 or higher

Java SE Development Kit â€“ Java 8 version
